Racetrack
A webapp to track swimming results. (still in development)

How to run?
We used Node.js, so I think you're going to have to download it. (We also used Supabase for the backend user accounts, but the URL and the key are all local in an env.local file on my machine, so I'm not sure if you're going to be able to login.)

Once you've done that, clone it to your local machine.
All the main files are under Orbital-25/frontend/nextjs-frontend/twonoobs, but there is a README in the backend folder if you want to read that.
Once you're in twonoobs, run npm install, then npm run dev. The app will appear at http://localhost:3000

The first page you see is the home page. There are a few buttons on the page that you can mess around with. 
On the top right of the home page is the login page, clicking that will bring you to the log in page where I have created 2 test accounts, admin1@test.com and admin2@test.com, the password is password.

That's about it for now.
